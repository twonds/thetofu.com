# Starting

I want to play around with reflex.dev and showcase and discuss aspects about usability, composability and operability.

## Goals

Build software that is simple, safe and satisfying.

Document the software and the process one step at a time. Attempt to make small changes with details about what, why and how.

Simple means that it is composable, reusable and easy to reason about. Boundaries and contracts are consise and clear. It allows focus on the portion or part of software we are developing.

Safe means easy to operate, easy to test, easy to measure, easy to understand and easy to protect.

Satisfying means it is fun to make changes and create. It is quick to iterate on and easy to solve complex problems without introducing complexity to the system.

## MVP

Start with implementing a simple blog or document viewer. You just make entries and they are displayed in a blog or time series format. Create a section to also display documents in a structured way to allow for documentation or non time series data.

I want to build a personal website at thetofu.com that displays information about me and a blog

Write an article about starting and delivering the MVP

Document future ideas, features and evolutions like publishing to other systems like medium etc.

## Platform(s)

I will try and go into more details on platforms. Right now, I have some basic tools to try out.

Use git for storing and managing markdown files for the site.

Use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for rendering markdown into html or other formats

Use Reflex(https://reflex.dev/) to build the software and explore its concepts and why those concepts resonate with my ideal software lifecycle.

Create a simple deploy mechanism for delivering the software.
